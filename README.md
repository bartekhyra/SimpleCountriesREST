# SimpleCountriesREST

It is a very simple Spring Boot REST application.

Initially I compiled it with Java 16 but shall be fine with Java 11 too.


In order to compile and build the app command required:
* mvn clean install


For all countries: http://localhost:8080/countries/

For chosen countries: http://localhost:8080/countries/eesti
